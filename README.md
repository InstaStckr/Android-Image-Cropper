## Change log
*1.2.2 (beta)*
 * Fix `setShowCropOverlay(boolean)` not working properly.
 * Fix crop window bounds issue when cropping image is too small relative to min/max bounds with fixed aspect ratio.
 * Fix crop window reset on on-screen keyboard show/hide.

*1.2.1 (beta)*

 * Fix crop window resize bug with fixed aspect ratio
 * Add `getRotatedDegrees()` to get how much the image was rotated during cropping
 * Add `setCropRect(Rect)` to set initial cropping window location and size to specific window on the image.

*1.2.0 (beta)*

Due too large changes in the internals please consider this a **beta** release, if you use it be sure to test is thoroughly and report any bugs you find (report no bugs will also be awesome) or use 1.1.0 until I feel 1.2.* is stable enough.
- Rewrite internal crop window handling.
-  Add `crop` prefix to all customization resources to prevent naming collision (**breaking change**).
- Add `CropImageView.Guidelines` enum of guidelines config instead of integer (**breaking change**).
- Change custom attributes types to `dimension` where appropriate (**breaking change**).
- Add `showCropOverlay` attribute and `setShowCropOverlay(boolean)` method allowing to hide/show crop overlay UI for animation or element transition.
- Add `cropInitialCropWindowPaddingRatio` customization [0 - 0.5) to control initial crop window padding from image borders relative to image size.
- Add min limit config on cropping window width/height in the UI (`cropMinCropWindowWidth`, `cropMinCropWindowHeight`)
- Add min/max config on cropping image result width/height (`cropMinCropResultWidthPX`,`cropMinCropResultHeightPX`,`cropMaxCropResultWidthPX`,`cropMaxCropResultHeightPX`)
